# Unity3D HTC Vive VR SBS Application 

The goal of this project (as a part of my master thesis) is to remotely control a Lego Mindstorms EV3 vehicle using the HTC Vive controller, while viewing a Side-By-Side real time video stream with the glass. MQTT is used as the communication protocol, as well as GStreamer for the stream. Therefore, the following plugings are utilized:
* [mrayGStreamerUnity](https://github.com/reime005/mrayGStreamerUnity)
* [Unity3d_MQTT](https://github.com/reime005/Unity3d_MQTT)
